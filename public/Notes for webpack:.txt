Notes for webpack:

WebpackReadyReactApp file structure:
-project folder
 -index.html
 -main.css
 -main.js
 -bundle.js
 -webpack.config.js
 -package.json 
 -node_modules (Contains all the other dependencies)


 github:
 1.create online repo and follow ALL instructions
 2.git add *
 3.git commit -m "commit message"
 4.git push origin master

 
 First commands:
$ git  --global user.name "name"
$ git --global user.email "email"

Create a Repository:
/A repository is just like a folder. It holds the project structure
You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even a single letter in a single file changed -- all of it's tracked and time stamped by Git. That's version control.

$ git init // initiates git to start tracking the current directory's  file contents

$ git status 	//Git repository status
				// Check to see if there have been any changes
$ git add filename //add files you would like to commit
$ git commit -m "commit message" //Submit the files you added to save
$ git diff	   //show diferences between files since last commit


github create a branch
